# Introduction

This repository shows some examples of [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) application in languages.
Sample programs calculate the maximum prime below "N" given as an argument. Those programs implement the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) which has very simple algorithm.

## Languages

**WebAssembly Available**

- [C](/category/c)
- [C++](/category/c-1)
- [Go](/category/go)
- [JavaScript](/category/javascript)
- [Rust](/category/rust)

**WebAssembly Unavailable**

- Python

**Future work**

- C#
- Elixier
- Java
- Julia
- Ruby


To compare with raw JavaScript with other languages, [Raw JavaScript](/run-raw-javascript) is also in the samples.

## Comparison with Raw JavaScript

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.

## Help Wanted

Improving program or adding new languages are appreciated :)
